    "answer": "If I can chime in, it seems like you're looking for ways to make math more engaging for your students. Right, that's definitely an area worth exploring.\n\nI think this post on scaffolding might be relevant: \"Scaffolding is a teaching technique used to support learning by providing temporary support as needed.\" It's interesting how some people see it as a way to reduce student independence, but others view it as a means to help students develop problem-solving skills.\n\nAlso, I love your idea of sharing videos with parents, like the shepherd video you mentioned earlier. What if we brainstorm ways to incorporate those kinds of interactive activities into your lesson plans?\n\n---\n**Sources:**\n**Source 1:** messagepairs.pdf (chunk 803)\n**Source 2:** messagepairs.pdf (chunk 1586)\n**Source 3:** messagepairs.pdf (chunk 385)\n",

    "question": "how do I get kids to ask open ended questions",
    "answer": "Yeah, getting kids to ask open-ended questions is a great goal. I've noticed that sometimes, students can get into a routine of just looking for answers, rather than exploring the problem. One approach that might help is using strategies like \"Notice and wonder\". You basically ask kids \"What do you notice?\" and \"What do you wonder?\" and it can lead to some great discoveries. It's a pretty informal way to encourage them to think critically and ask open-ended questions. For example, you could try having them share what they notice and wonder about a particular problem or scenario, and see where the conversation takes them. What do you think about giving that a try?",
