    "answer": "If I can chime in, it seems like you're looking for ways to make math more engaging for your students. Right, that's definitely an area worth exploring.\n\nI think this post on scaffolding might be relevant: \"Scaffolding is a teaching technique used to support learning by providing temporary support as needed.\" It's interesting how some people see it as a way to reduce student independence, but others view it as a means to help students develop problem-solving skills.\n\nAlso, I love your idea of sharing videos with parents, like the shepherd video you mentioned earlier. What if we brainstorm ways to incorporate those kinds of interactive activities into your lesson plans?\n\n---\n**Sources:**\n**Source 1:** messagepairs.pdf (chunk 803)\n**Source 2:** messagepairs.pdf (chunk 1586)\n**Source 3:** messagepairs.pdf (chunk 385)\n",

    "question": "how do I get kids to ask open ended questions",
    "answer": "Yeah, getting kids to ask open-ended questions is a great goal. I've noticed that sometimes, students can get into a routine of just looking for answers, rather than exploring the problem. One approach that might help is using strategies like \"Notice and wonder\". You basically ask kids \"What do you notice?\" and \"What do you wonder?\" and it can lead to some great discoveries. It's a pretty informal way to encourage them to think critically and ask open-ended questions. For example, you could try having them share what they notice and wonder about a particular problem or scenario, and see where the conversation takes them. What do you think about giving that a try?",

    "question": "how do I get kids to think about open middle problems",
    "answer": "Yeah, getting kids to think about open-middle problems can be a challenge, but it's such a valuable skill to develop. I've noticed that when students are faced with problems they don't understand right away, they can shut down and not write anything. But what if we could encourage them to take a step back, reflect on their thinking, and explore different approaches? \n\nIt seems to me that using open-middle problems in class can help students develop this skill. As Robert Kaplinsky's work suggests, open-middle problems can help reveal gaps in students' understandings. I'd love to explore this idea further - what do you think about having students create their own open-middle problems? Maybe that's a way to challenge them to reflect on their deeper understanding of a concept and become the puzzle maker rather than just the solver. How do you think we could support students in making this shift?",
